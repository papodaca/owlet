/* libei-shim.c
 *
 * C helpers wrapping libei's sentinel-terminated variadic functions
 * so they can be called from Vala without binding the varargs. Only
 * the KEYBOARD + TEXT (since libei 1.6) capabilities are bound, which
 * is all Owlet's dictation mode needs.
 *
 * TEXT (EI_DEVICE_CAP_TEXT = 1 << 6) was added in libei 1.6. On older
 * libei the value is unknown to the EIS implementation and
 * ei_seat_bind_capabilities treats unknown caps as a no-op, so this
 * shim is safe to compile against any libei-1.0.
